            <p>The Cane Corso, also known as the Italian Mastiff, is a large working breed from Italy. Weighing an impressive 90 to 120 pounds and standing 23 to 28 inches at the shoulder,
                 Cani Corsi (the Italian plural form of Cane Corso) were first bred as guardians of the homestead and herd. The Cane Corso can immediately be recognized by their muscular build, 
                 square head, and silky coat. Despite their reputation for being “aggressive,” there’s much more to this Mastiff breed than meets the eye. Like other Pit Bull dog breeds,
                  these pups have faced unjust stigma from their use in dog fighting.
                 As a result, they are sometimes categorized as banned breeds through no fault of their own.<br>
