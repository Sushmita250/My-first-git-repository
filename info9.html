        <p>The long-haired Chihuahua tends to bond closely with one or two people,
             with whom he will be curious, lively and intelligent, as well as deeply and constantly affectionate.
              However, without adequate early socialisation, the breed will not take kindly to strangers and can appear nervous, 
              yappy and even snappy.<br>
