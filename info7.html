            <p>The Bichon Frise (pronounced BEE-shawn FREE-say; the plural is Bichons Frises) is a cheerful,
                 small dog breed with a love of mischief and a lot of love to give. Their black eyes and fluffy white coat make them look almost like a child’s toy.
                  this breed is a great option for those looking for a small dog that doesn’t shed — or at least doesn’t shed much. 
                  Even with hypoallergenic dogs,it’s hard to determine how hypoallergenic they’ll be.<br>
                Colors: Dark Golden, Light Golden, Cream, Golden
                height: 9 to 11 inches tall at the shoulder <br>
                Life expectancy: 12 – 15 years</p>
